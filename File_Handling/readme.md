## P1- You have two files named questions.txt and answer.txt. You need to create a file that contains questions and answers. But both input files contain random questions followed by a numeric value. You need to match both values and then copy the question-answer pair in a new file.
 -> Optimize code properly. <br>
 Sample file: question.txt:<br>
 #### 3. What is your Hobby?
 #### 1. What is your name?
 #### 2. Where are you from?
 <br>
 Sample file: answer.txt:<br>
 2. India <br>
 1. Bob<br>
 3. Swimming<br><br>
 Output file:<br>
 1. What is your name?<br>
 Bob<br>
 2. Where are you from?<br>
 	India<br>
 3. What is your Hobby?<br>
 	Swimming<br><br> 
 
**Input:** Two files named question.txt and answer.txt<br>
**Output:** A file containg both questions and answers in correct sequence.
