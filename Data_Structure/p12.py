# Create a simulation program for Hot Potato Game.
# You can develop with your ideas. Just take care of the following things:
# - At least one person must remove from each round.
# - Display name in the console that which user has a hot potato.
# - Each user holds a potato for random seconds between 0.1 to 3.0
# - Each round starts after 3 seconds of the previous elimination.
# - Each round stops at random seconds between 5 to 20.
# - Display the name of the winner.
