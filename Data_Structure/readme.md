## P1 - Slice list into 3 equal chunks and reverse each chunk.<br><br>

**Input:** List of integers and number of chunks N you want to slice the list into.<br>
**Output:** List of N chunks in reversed order. <br><br>

   | Input | Output |
| ----- | ----- |
| 3, [11,45,8,23,14,12] | [[45, 11], [23, 8], [12, 14]] |
|  2, [1,4,6,7,5,0]  | [[6, 4, 1], [0, 5, 7]] |
#
## P2 - Count the occurrence of each element from a list
<br>

**Input:** Non-empty list of integers.<br>
**Output:** Dictionary of elements with their occurrence.<br>

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ----- |
| [11, 45, 8, 11, 23, 45, 23, 45, 89] | {11: 2, 45: 3, 8: 1, 23: 2, 89: 1} |
#


## P3 - Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples.
<br>

**Input:** Non-empty list of tuples<br>
**Output:** List sorted with the last element of each tuple.

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ----- |
| [(2, 5, 8), (1, 2), (4, 4, 9, 6), (3, 3), (2, 1)] | [(2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4, 9, 6), (2, 5, 8)] |
#


## P4 -  Find the intersection (common) of two sets and remove those elements from the first set.
 <br>


**Input:** Two sets, set1 and set2<br>
**Output:** Two sets, one containing intersection of two and the other containing elements present in set1 but not in set2.

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ----- |
| {23, 42, 65, 57, 78, 83, 29} <br> {57, 83, 29, 67, 73, 43, 48} | {57, 83, 29} {65, 42, 78, 23} |

#

## P5 - Sort given array of three random elements. 0,1 & 2. Without any sorting algorithm. Time complexity: O(n)
<br>

**Input:** non-empty list contains 0,1,2 multiple times<br>
**Output:** output as a sorted list without using sorted algorithm

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ----- |
| [1,0,2,2,0,1,0,1,2,0,0] | [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]  |
